React.js: Computational inefficiencies and deprecation models provide that the provided code suffers from some performance bottlenecks:
Incorrect filtering: The filter in useMemo should be Balance.amount > 0 to exclude zero/negative balances.
Redundant computation: getPriority is called multiple times. Prioritize calculations first.
Unnecessary re-rendering: Inline function definition causes re-rendering. Move them outside the component or remember.
Combine filtering, sorting, and formatting into a single user memo.
Refactored code: The provided refactored code addresses these issues by: Fixing the filter condition. Prioritize before calculating. Use useMemo effectively. Combine sorting, filtering, and formatting. This improves performance and code clarity.
